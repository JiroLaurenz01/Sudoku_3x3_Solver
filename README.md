## How the Solver Works

The 3x3 Sudoku solver employs logical thinking and simple algorithms to find solutions for Sudoku puzzles. It uses logical deduction and constraint checking to ensure each number placed in a cell adheres to Sudoku rules without resorting to guessing or backtracking.

## How the Generator Works

The 3x3 Sudoku generator randomly selects a predefined number of cells to keep empty, depending on the chosen difficulty level (easy, normal, or hard). It ensures the generated puzzle has a unique solution and is solvable with logical reasoning.
